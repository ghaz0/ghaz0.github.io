                        <div class="col-lg-6">
                            <p class="paragraphStyle">I'm currently a Computer Science major at Bridgewater State, and I also have attained a Bachelor's in English (Class of 2019). I've studied abroad at Wadham College in Oxford (United Kingdom), have written an Honors Thesis about
                                Icelandic Sagas, and while I was an English Major I served as an editor for volumes 15 and 16 of the Bridge, the student-made art and literature journal at Bridgewater State University. These credentials and mile-markers may
                                appear like the makings of someone with a career either in teaching or publishing. Alas, I had no interest in the former and in the latter I had no luck with publishing being a field where you either know your way into a job,
                                have the money to pay your way into getting those connections, or endlessly scrolling down job listings that are the classic Catch-22 of "Looking for entry-level applicants, must have the experience of a newly-minted industry veteran".
                                <br></br> Outside of academics, I usually mention on my resumes that I've worked as a retail associate at Target. Of course, first thing you're supposed to do on a resume implicitly is sell yourself at the risk of overselling. Fortunately,
                                the Target Corporation has got me covered and so in my department I work under the title of "Tech Consultant" and not "Sales Associate" as applicable as that also is.

                                There's a few other job's I've done that aren't so official or
                                applicable to any forms this coming tax season (2022). I've done the job that most others have worked at, fast-food, McDonalds. I worked there for a summer as opposed to my almost four years now in retail. I've also interned at a Newspaper, and after a few months I learned the importance of not jumping into an internship because another person
                                is egging me into doing so. <br></br>
                                I could go on with the career adventures I've had here and there, though to keep this brief I'll just say one more thing. During freshman year at community college I had also 
                                assisted in the proofreading of an academic work regarding the intelligentsia of East Germany after the fall of the Berlin Wall. I worked with a 
                                sociology professor on his 300 page manuscript and checked for the baseline errors: spelling, syntax, and grammar. <br></br> All in all, that is a summary of what I've done that's
                                CV worthy.

                        <div class="col-lg">
                            <p class="paragraphStyle"> First and foremost, I am no entrepreneur. I've done the whole "interview applicants" before, about 30-40 applications to be specific, and so I can confidently say I've sat on both sides of the interview desk. By this I 
                                do not mean that sometime in middle school I was recruiting from class other kids to help sell lemonade for a class project. I am referring to hiring contractors skilled in 2D art and design, 3D graphics, sound designers/engineers, composers,
                                and programmers. This was no hobby, but a professional ambition that fell flat because I learned that I am not built for any management position. I invested over two grand in the initial pursuit, and could've spent more had Covid-19 not hit.
                                I spoke with publishers (not just representatives but publisher heads, face-to-face) at conventions like PAX East and was prepared to fly out to Los Angeles for GDC, the Game Developer Convention, to pitch the game whose development I was heading before 
                                publishers and attain funding. There was also plans for crowdfunding. Had COVID not caused GDC's cancellation, I would've spent just about three grand for the flight, the hotel, and convention pass, and all on the savings I had gathered from working retail.
                                <br></br>I've told the details to many, but to summarize it, I learned that it is often better to take the long and hard road to learn how to do things myself than to try and take a shortcut by outsourcing what I need for my projects to succeed to the goodwill of strangers. In this case, that shortcut
                                was thinking I could easily outsource the rest of the work involved in indie game development to a team of mostly beginner-level commissioned artists and programmers. 
                                </p>
                        </div>

                            <p class="paragraphStyle">
                                I discovered for myself why the people who are willing to do something initially for free (until it
                                returns a profit) are not the best for entrusting most of development work to, and how that leads to abandonment, sabotage, and disappointment. I learned that indie projects are best done within closely knit circles of long-term friends, or by a key developer who can do the bulk of the work on their own. 
                                <br></br> For a little more than a year now, I've been
                                working on coding, 2D art and illustration, and 3D graphics and design. I'm working on the same game but as a new project, with a new design approach, and with all assets coming from my hands to keep my nose clean in legal and financial terms.
                                I've invested another two grand overall in assets, materials, and resources to help me pick up
                                the skills I need to continue with this professional pursuit. My current ambition and goal is to get myself in a position where I can leave my current dayjob and work entirely off this pursuit. This isn't only for idealistic or romantic reasons, but also
                                because should my efforts succeed I will have found an anti-fragile career which is the type of career I want. It's a career I can be free to engage in artistic pursuits that a "regular" job might restrict me
                                from for reasons related to the interests of business and industry expectations.
