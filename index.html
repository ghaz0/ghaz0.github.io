                            <p class="paragraphStyle">I'm currently a Computer Science major at Bridgewater State, and I also have attained a Bachelor's in English (Class of 2019). I've studied abroad at Wadham College in Oxford (United Kingdom), have written an Honors Thesis about
                                Icelandic Sagas, and while I was an English Major I served as an editor for volumes 15 and 16 of the Bridge, the student-made art and literature journal at Bridgewater State University. These credentials and mile-markers may
                                appear like the makings of someone with a career either in teaching or publishing. Alas, I had no interest in the former and in the latter I had difficulty with publishing being a field where you either know your way into a job,
                                have the money to pay your way into getting those connections, or endlessly scrolling down job listings that are the classic Catch-22 of "Looking for entry-level applicants, must have the experience of a newly-minted industry veteran". It also
                                did not help that my search began in the summer of 2019 and continued into the spring of 2020.
                                <br></br>

                                There's a few other job's I've done that aren't so official or
                                applicable to any forms this coming tax season (2022). I've done the job that most others have worked at: McDonalds. I worked there for a summer as opposed to my almost four years now in retail. I've also interned at a local newspaper, 
                                and after a few months I learned the importance of not jumping into an internship because I was
                                egged into doing so. <br></br>
                                I could go on with the career adventures I've had here and there, though to keep this brief I'll just say one more thing. During freshman year at community college I had also 
                                assisted in the proofreading of an academic work regarding the intelligentsia of East Germany after the fall of the Berlin Wall. I worked with a 
                                sociology professor on his 300 page manuscript and checked for the baseline errors: spelling, syntax, and grammar. One thing I enjoy about proofreading and coding is the whole meditative process of a focused
                                review and revision.

                        <h2 class="content-subhead">What I Do That's Related to Professional Pursuits</h2>
                        <div class="col-lg">
                            <p class="paragraphStyle"> First and foremost, I am ambitious but I wouldn't consider myself an entrepreneur but more along the lines of an aspiring contractor. I've sat on both sides of the interview desk, and in one instance not too long ago I looked over about
                                 30-40 applications. It was a search for contractors skilled in 2D art and design, 3D graphics, sound designers/engineers, composers,
                                and programmers. This was no hobby, but a professional ambition that fell flat because I learned that I am not built for any management position. I invested over two grand in the initial pursuit, and could've spent more had Covid-19 not hit.
                                I spoke with publishers (not just representatives but publisher heads, face-to-face) at conventions like PAX East and was prepared to fly out to Los Angeles for GDC, the Game Developer Convention, to pitch the game whose development I was heading before 
                                publishers and attain funding. There was also plans for crowdfunding. Had COVID not caused GDC's cancellation, I would've spent just about three grand for the flight, the hotel, and convention pass, and all on the savings I had gathered from working retail.
                                <br></br>I've told the details to many, but to summarize it, I learned that it is sometimes a better bet to take the long and hard road to learn how to do things myself 
                                than to try and take a shortcut and outsource essential work to the goodwill of strangers. In this case, that shortcut
                                was thinking I could easily outsource the rest of the work involved in indie game development to a team of commissioned,mostly beginner-level artists and programmers.

                            For a little more than a year now, I've been
                                working on coding, 2D art and illustration, and 3D graphics and design. I'm working on the same game but as a new project, with a new design approach, and with all assets coming from my hands to keep my nose clean legally and financially.
                                I've invested another two grand overall in assets, materials, and resources to help me pick up
                                the skills I need to continue with this professional pursuit. My current ambition and goal is to be able to work independently not as a contractor but self-employed where my clientelle is an audience. Idealism and romance are but the icing, as the
                                meat of the cake is the pragmatism of this career path. It's a career path where I can be free to engage in doing work that a "regular" job might exclude me from doing even in my spare time due to business interests and industry expectations.
