        <h1>Current Project Mindmap</h1>
        <p>Here is a collage of inspirations I draw upon for the main project I work on 
            outside of class and my dayjob. My inspiration process consists of picking up
            aesthetics, themes, and gameplay mechanics that kept bringing me back to these 
            properties. If I notice anything in these properties that I have
            already considered, I take note of the execution and what changes I would make.
